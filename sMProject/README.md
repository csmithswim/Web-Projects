Today's project is to make the back end programming for a social media website/app that will upload Users and Posts to a MongoDB server using CRUD methods.

1:[] initialize your project
2:[] install the dependencies you know you'll need from the beginning
3:[] Set up your app/index.js aka. your main Node server file.
  *some steps that are necessary and should be done first. create your server instance, connect to mongo, make sure the server is listening
4:[] create your user router
5:[] create User model
6:[] create routes to work with users collection. order of creation for me typically goes: POST, GET, DELETE, PATCH. Really it only matters that POST is the first you create.
6.5:[] Test the heck out of everything
7:[] create a Post model then message me
